					JavaAndLaplaceFilter

The principal of sharp is£º
	When the middle of the pixel is lower than the average (mean value) of the neighbors£¨4 or 8£©then the middle pixel should be much lower,
 otherwise,it should be much higher.

	The Laplace filter=
	{
		 0	-1	 0
		-1	 4	-1
		 0	-1	 0
	};

	or:

	The Laplace filter=
	{
		-1	-1	-1
		-1	 8	-1
		-1	-1	-1
	};

The Principal Of LaplaceFilter is£º

	 when the result of filer F is bigger than zero£¬the new value of pixel = pixel+F*scale  is higher,
otherwise it would be lower, and the effect  is connected with the constant scale.
So , the result is : 
	newCenter=scale*[center-(left+right+up+down)/4] 
or
	newCenter=scale*[4*center-(left+right+up+down)] 
So , It is the Laplace filter=
{
	 0	-1	 0
	-1	 4	-1
	 0	-1	 0
};
It is also called unsharp marsking: it can enhance the contour.
