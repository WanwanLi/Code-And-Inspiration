If you want to open the webpage with loding texture from other files,  
there are two options:
1. Run the code on the local website server: for example resin
http://127.0.0.1:8080/JavaAndTexture/JavaAndCube.html
2. Open Chrome.exe with cmd
cd C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application
chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files
